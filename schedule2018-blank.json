It encourages participation and communication - and because of that, it’s ideal for a convention like Foolscap. It was developed in 1984 as a way of changing how organizations hold meetings and it’s been used in groups as small as five and as large as 2,100. Our organizers have had experience with groups from 60 to 300, and really like how it works:<p>1. You come to the convention with ideas.<p>2. You come to Columbia A for that day’s hour-long Program Generation Session on Friday at 4 pm and Saturday at 11 am. There the organizers supply forms and pens so you can write down your idea. It can be a topic for round-table discussion, a conversation you want to have with someone else at the convention that you’d like others to watch, a demonstration of something cool you know about, a game you want to play, a problem you want help solving, or any other idea.<p>3. After everyone’s ideas are written down, we read them out. Sometimes ideas are similar and can be combined, with the consent of the proposers.<p>4. Everyone at the session, proposers and audience, is given a strip of five dot stickers. We lay out all the proposals for topics so they’re visible and folks go around and put dots on the items they most want to see happen. If you really want a topic - give it multiple dots!<p>5. We schedule the topics into our Open Space time slots.<p>6. Enjoy yourself! If you’re not enjoying yourself, move to another item and enjoy yourself there.<p>Tom Whitmore, Open Space Coordinator"
